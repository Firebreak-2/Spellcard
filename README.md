# Spellcard

Spellcard is a Discord bot whoâ€™s goal is to provide users with easily customizable commands that can be modified at runtime.

These commands can have a user-set name to call from, and a response which the bot will reply with when called.

Spellcard was made using the Discord.NET bot API, as well as a few other libraries.
